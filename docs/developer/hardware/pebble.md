# Pebble Tracker

# Overview

IoTeX's Pebble Tracker meets the demand of applications that require strong data security, integrity protection, and multiparty trust across the entire supply chain. Existing asset tracking solutions lack critical security features, rendering them easily hackable and exposed to data corruption.

## Features

Pebble Tracker combines an **environmental sensor** (temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, altitude, and volatile organic compounds - VOCs), a **motion sensor** (3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer), and an ambient **light sensor**. It's also equipped with cellular network connectivity and integrated GPS supporting precise, long range tracking of asset data using established cellular infrastructure.

## Versions

There are two versions of Pebble Tracker. The first targets blockchain and IoT developers while a second commercial version is designed for the asset tracking and industrial supply chain market.
