# Smart Contracts

IoTeX Blockchain integrates the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is widely used by blockchain developers. Existing EVM-based dApps can be already ported over to the IoTeX Network **with no changes**!

## Solidity Programming Language

You can use **Solidity** as a programming language for IoTeX smart contracts: the blockchain is 100% compliant with Solidity syntax, up to it's latest release.

You can find many resources about smart contract programming with Solidity on the Internet: starting from the [official docs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/#the-solidity-contract-oriented-programming-language), to this [best practice handbook](https://yos.io/2019/11/10/smart-contract-development-best-practices/) and the popular [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) interactive course, plenty of choices are available!

Another great source to start with is this book form 'O Really: [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps - 1st Edition](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook#mastering-ethereum) that is freely readable on GitHub.

## Smart contracts: IoTeX Vs Ethereum

Although IoTeX smart contracts are fully compatible with Ethereum ones, developing your contracts on the IoTeX blockchain will bring some additional benefits: IoTeX is designed to be a IoT-Friendly platform, where the blockchain is the orchestrating layer for devices coordination and end-to-end trusted data transfers.

For this reason, the IoTeX design provides a fast and scalable blockchain: that means **your smart contracts on IoTeX will run with a 5-second confirmation time**, **instant finality of transactions**, and negligible transaction fees! Additionally, with the unique-of-his-kind [IoTeX Tokenomics](https://medium.com/@iotex/iotex-tokenomics-part-1-utility-of-the-iotx-token-781ff9c866e3) in place, millions of _"Powered by IoTeX"_ [IoT devices](https://www.nordicsemi.com/News/2020/02/IoTeXs-Cellular-IoT-based-tracker-delivers-environmental-and-condition-data-for-assets-in-transit) getting registered on the blockchain, more an more [services providers](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/case-study-iotex/) joining the ecosystem, the IoTeX blockchain is the perfect environment for deploying smart contracts that will be used in real world applications!
