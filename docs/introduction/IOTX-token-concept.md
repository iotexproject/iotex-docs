# IOTX Token

As for other similar Smart-Contract platforms, in IoTeX we have the concept of "**native token**": a token that is an integral part of the blockchain protocol and has multiple uses focused to run the platform itself. The native token on the IoTeX blockchain is called "IOTX", and it is used for paying GAS fees when you send actions to the network (such as token transfers, smart contract executions, staking actions, etc...), but it's also used to reward block producers for maintaining the blockchain, or for cross-chain actions to transfer assets across different IoTeX subchains or to other blockchains.

## IOTX Fractions

There are 6 fractions of the IOTX tokens, described below

| Fraction | Description                                 | IOTX Value            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Rau      | Rau is the smallest non-fungible token unit | 10<sup>-18</sup> IOTX |
| KRau     | 1 KRau = 1000 \* 1 Rau                      | 10<sup>-15</sup> IOTX |
| MRau     | 1 MRau = 1000 \* 1 KRau                     | 10<sup>-12</sup> IOTX |
| GRau     | 1 GRau = 1000 \* 1 MRau                     | 10<sup>-9</sup> IOTX  |
| Qev      | 1 Qev = 1000 \* 1 GRau                      | 10<sup>-6</sup> IOTX  |
| Jing     | 1 Jing = 1000 \* 1 Qev                      | 10<sup>-3</sup> IOTX  |
| IOTX     | 1 IOTX = 1000 \* 1 Jing                     | 1 IOTX                |
